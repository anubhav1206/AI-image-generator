# AI-image-generator
A fully responsive text-to-image AI web app built with react that generates 1024x1024 images based on the prompt provided with the help of Open AI API. In its current form, the user can generate images but not download them, which is a functionality I am yet to add.
I also plan on adding a functionality of all the AI generated images being displayed on the home page, but it is throwing a cors error, so i am yet to fix that.

# How to run
1. Go to the client directory and run "npm install" and "npm run dev"
2. Split up the terminal, navigate to server directory and run "npm install" and npm start
